# Step 1: Data Structures
## I. Linear Data Structures - Operations and Applications

- Arrays : Actions adding/inserting/deleting elements from front,end, in-between. traversing (displaying each element), searching& sorting, largest and smallest element. Once you understand the basic concepts of these actions on Arrays, unerstanding and implementing them on rest of the data structures will become very much easier.
- Queue( using Array)
- Circular Queue (using Array)
- Stack(using Array)
- Double Stack(using Arrays)
- Linked list(singly, circular, doubly, doubly circular)

- Strings

## II. Non-Linear (Hierarchical) data strucrures- Operations & Applications

- Trees
- Search Trees
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Red-Black Tree
- [Graphs](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-adjacency-list)
- Tables (Hashing Techniques)
- Sets
